# Juicy Bar
Juicy Bar is a modern Jeopardy-style capture the flag (CTF) app for Android written in Kotlin. The app, contains a large number of hidden flags that players must find. The flags range in difficulty, so there are challenges suitable for players of all skill levels. Some flags can be found with little prior knowledge, while others may require more advanced skills to uncover.

Juicy Bar covers a wide range of topics, including common pitfalls and problems that can be seen in real world Android applications. The app is designed to provide players with new skills, rather than just testing their existing ones. It provides hints when needed that suggests what the player need to learn more about to solve the challenges.
